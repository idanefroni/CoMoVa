The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO2 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO3, AtMLO6 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots, in vascular system of cotyledons and young leaves,and in fruit abscission zone; it was not expressed in anthers and pollen, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s). mlo resistance in  A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules ethylene,  jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin,  glycosyl hydrolase and ABC transporter."

In vitro binding assays indicate that PYM can bind to MAGO and Y14 either individually, or when they are together. But, MAGO-Y14-PYM ternary complexes are difficult to detect in vivo in Arabidopsis based on pull-down experiments. However there is some evidence for a weak association in Arabidopsis flowers. PYM appears primarily cytoplasmic, but it also seems to into the nucleus at times. Its nuclear localization signal has not been rigorously defined, but there is evidence for a nuclear export signal between amino acids 171-205 in the C-terminus."

3301,AT1G23260,MMZ1,"MMZ1/UEV1A encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage."

Arabidopsis thaliana genome has a single Fu gene. Cytokinesis-defective mutants, which we named two-in-one (tio), result from mutations in Arabidopsis Fu. Phenotypic analysis of tio mutants reveals an essential role for TIO in conventional modes of cytokinesis in plant meristems and during male gametogenesis. TIO is tightly localized to the midline of the nascent phragmoplast and remains associated with the expanding phragmoplast ring. This gene was previously annotated as two gene models, AT1G50230.1 and AT1G50240.1, however the experimental evidence exists (Oh et al, Current Biology, 2005) showing that these two models are in fact single gene, named FUSED."

ARF1 enhances mutant phenotypes of ARF2 and may act with ARF2 to control aspects of maturation and senescence.ARF1:LUC and 3xHA:ARF1 proteins have a half-life of ~3-4 hours and their degradation is reduced by proteasome inhibitors. 3xHA:ARF1 degradation is not affected by a pre-treatment with IAA. A nuclear-targeted fusion protein containing the middle region of ARF1 linked to LUC:NLS has a similar half-life to the full-length ARF1:LUC construct. The degradation of 3xHA:ARF1 is not affected in an axr6-3 mutant grown at room temperature, although the degradation of AXR2/IAA7 is slowed under these conditions."

7788,AT1G68910,WIT2,"Encodes one of the WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIT1/AT5G11390, WIT2/AT1G68910) required for RanGAP nuclear envelope association in root tip cells.  Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells."

Therefore, homozygous otp51 mutants have profound photosynthetic defects and can only survive in sucrose-supplemented in vitro cultures under low light conditions. OTP51 may also be involved in splicing several other transcripts and precursor forms of the trnL, trnG, trnI, and trnA transcripts also accumulate in otp51 mutants. Although OTP51 shares some homology with DNA endonucleases, it lacks key catalytic residues suggesting that it does not participate in DNA cleavage."

The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal, stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing, stamen formation, and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5, ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium, consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.

Mutations in IBR3 render   plants resistant to indole-3-butryic acid, a putative storage form of the biologically active auxin IAA  (indole-3-acetic acid). IBR3 is hypothesized to carry out the second step in a  &#946;-oxidation-like process of IBA metabolism in Arabidopsis.  Though its subcellular location has not been determined, IBR3 has a peroxisomal targeting  sequence and  two other putative IBA metabolic enzymes (IBR1 and IBR10)  can be found in this organelle. No specific enzymatic activity has been  documented for IBR3, but double mutant analyses with CHY1 argue against a role for IBR3 in general fatty  acid &#946;-oxidation."

16554,AT3G10800,BZIP28,"Encodes bZIP28, a putative membrane-tethered transcriptional factor. Up-regulated in response to heat; a bZIP28 null mutant has a heat-sensitive phenotype.  bZIP28 has a similar domain structure to the mammalian ATF6 protein involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), and shares a bZIP domain, transmembrane domain, and a canonical S1P cleavage site. The bZIP28 seems to be glycosylated in vivo. bZIP28 does not appear to be transcriptionally up-regulated by UPR-inducing tunicamycin (TM) treatment. But, the expression level of three UPR-related genes is reduced in TM-treated zip28 mutants relative to wild type seedlings. And several UPR genes are transcriptionally upregulated when an N-terminal portion of the bZIP28 protein is expressed using the 35S promoter. A myc:bZIP28 fusion protein appears to be cleaved, likely at a canonical S2 cleavage site, following a TM treatment or a DTT stress-inducing treatment, but not a salt treatment. A portion of the  mGFP:bZIP28 protein present in root cells appears to translocate from the cytoplasm and ER to the nucleus following TM treatment."

The DAYSLEEPER gene lacks 8 bp duplications and TIRs (a common feature of transcriptionally silent hAT transposases), however, DAYSLEEPER expression was detected, and several expressed sequence tags are available. The expression seems to be under the control of factors determining the circadian rhythm.

It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM2 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs."

Non-acetylated H3 peptide or an H3 peptide that had been  previously acetylated on K9 both serve as excellent substrates  for HAG1-catalyzed acetylation. However, prior acetylation  of H3 lysine 14 blocks radioactive acetylation of the  peptide by HAG1.  HAG1 is specific for  histone H3 lysine 14."

Knockdown mutants (RNAi) show a dwarf phenotype at the normal atmospheric partial oxygen pressure of 21 kPa.  This dwarf phenotype could be rescued by growing the plant under low oxygen pressure (5kPa), suggesting a role for this gene in oxygen sensing."

In silico analyses reveal nine mei2 -like genes in A. thaliana. They were grouped into four distinct clades, based on overall sequence similarity and subfamily-specific sequence elements. AML3 is a member of two sister clades of mei2-like gene family, AML1 through AML5, and belongs to the clade named ALM235. Among mei2-like genes, AML3 is the transcript with highest frequency of alternative splicing. Expression was detected during early embryo development (heart and torpedo stage); no accumulation was detected in vegetative and floral apices, as revealed by in situ hybridization."

CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK3 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  CPK6 is also a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK family."

25667,AT4G25350,SHB1,SHB1 encodes a nuclear and cytosolic protein that has motifs  homologous with SYG1 protein family members. Acts in cryptochrome signaling. Overexpression of SHB1 enhanced the expression of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING  FACTOR4 (PIF4) under red light and promoted proteasome-mediated degradation of phytochrome A and hypocotyl elongation under far-red light. A knockout allele suppressed LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED LIGHT1 (HFR1) expression and showed several deetiolation  phenotypes. Acts upstream of HFR1. Regulates seed development.

One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization. Generally, it is suggested that the complete LD is the determinant of subcellular sorting in both animal and plant R-SNAREs."

One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization. Generally, it is suggested that the complete LD is the determinant of subcellular sorting in both animal and plant R-SNAREs."

27780,AT4G39400,ATBRI1,"Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus."

JKD can interact with the SCR and SHR proteins implicated in root patterning, as well as another zinc finger transcription factor, MAGPIE. All of these interactions require the first zinc finger in JKD according to a Y2H assay. There are also transcriptional interactions among these proteins. The initiation of JKD transcription does not appear to depend on SCR and SHR, but later expression in the post-embryonic QC cells and ground tissue initials is reduced in scr and shr mutants. JKD also appears to be required for SCR transcription beginning in the embryo. There is also some evidence that JKD plays a role in promoting the movement of SHR into the nucleus, particularly in QC cells, but this may be indirect."

Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells."

Acts downstream of CTR1 and ethylene biosynthesis, in the same pathway as EIN2 and AUX1, and independent from EIN3 and EIN5/AIN1 pathway. In the root, the protein localizes apically in epidermal and lateral root cap cells and predominantly basally in cortical cells. Functions may be regulated by phosphorylation status. EIR1 expression is induced by brassinolide treatment in the brassinosteroid-insensitive br1 mutant. Gravistimulation resulted in asymmetric PIN2 distribution, with more protein degraded at the upper side of the gravistimulated root. Protein turnover is affected by the proteasome and by endosomal cycling. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. Membrane sterol composition is essential for the acquisition of  PIN2 polarity."

34911,AT5G58230,MSI1,"Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1."

LIP1 also seems to negatively affect light-pulse-dependent resetting of the clock, especially during the first portion of the subjective evening. LIP1 expression levels are not significantly affected by the circadian clock in seedlings grown under LL conditions. The levels of the YFP:LIP1 protein expressed under the control of the 35S promoter, shows a low amplitude variation, with protein levels peaking near the beginning of subjective night under LL conditions. In hypocotyl epidermal cells of dark and light-grown seedlings, a YFP:LIP1 fusion protein can be seen in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and does not cluster in nuclear speckles.

Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification.
